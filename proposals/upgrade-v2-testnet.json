 "title": "AtomOne v2 Upgrade",
 "summary": "The AtomOne v2 release is a major release that will follow the standard\ngovernance process by initially submitting this post on the CommonWealth\nAtomOne forum. After collecting forum feedback (~1 week) and adapting the\nproposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the AtomOne chain\nfor voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 3 weeks.\n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the AtomOne\nchain binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal\n\n## Release Binary \u0026 Upgrade Resources\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that AtomOne v2 binary MUST be used.\n\nThe release can be found [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc1).\n\nThe upgrade guide can be found [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/blob/main/UPGRADING.md).\n\n## Proposed Release Contents\n\nThis release introduces the following major new feature:\n\n- Add the `x/photon` module\n\nAlthough this feature will make the `photon` token the sole fee token, the v2\nupgrade will implement this change gradually. Rather than immediately rejecting\ntransactions using `atone` tokens for fees, we'll provide a transition period\nfor users to switch to `photon`. During this time, both `photon` and `atone`\n    will be accepted as fee tokens. A subsequent parameter change proposal will\n    then establish `photon` as the exclusive fee token.\n\nThe other changes can be found in the changelog [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v200).\n\n## Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v2 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests and\nintegration tests. \n\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a\ntest upgrade to a release candidate before the AtomOne upgrades to the final\nrelease.\n\n## Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there\nalways exists a risk that the AtomOne experience problems due to potential bugs\nor errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators\nshould stop operating the network immediately. Coordination with validators\nwill happen in the #validator-private channel of the AtomOne Community Discord\nto create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency\nrelease with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and\nrevert back to the previous release of AtomOne (v1.1.2)\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this\nproposal:\n\nYES - You agree that the AtomOne chain should be updated with this release.\n\nNO - You disagree that the AtomOne chain should be updated with this release.\n\nABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote\neither for or against the proposal.\n"
