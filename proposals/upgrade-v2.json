  "summary": "# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal replaces [proposal #7](https://www.mintscan.io/atomone/proposals/7), which was mistakenly submitted as a text proposal. Please ignore proposal #7, votes on this proposal will have no effect on the upgrade.\n\n# AtomOne v2 upgrade\n\nThe AtomOne v2 release is a major release that will follow the standard\ngovernance process. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 3 weeks. \n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the AtomOne\nchain binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal\n\n# Release Binary \u0026 Upgrade Resources\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that AtomOne v2 binary MUST be used.\n\nThe release can be found [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/releases/tag/v2.0.0).\n\nThe upgrade guide can be found [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/blob/main/UPGRADING.md).\n\n# Proposed Release Contents\n\nThis release introduces the following major new feature:\n\n- Add the `x/photon` module\n\nAlthough this feature will make the `photon` token the sole fee token, the v2\nupgrade will implement this change gradually. Rather than immediately rejecting\ntransactions using `atone` tokens for fees, a transition period for users to\nswitch to `photon` will be provided. During this time, both `photon` and\n`atone` will be accepted as fee tokens. Pending governance approval, a\nsubsequent parameter change proposal, will then establish `photon` as the\nexclusive fee token.\n\nThe other changes can be found in the changelog [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v200).\n\n# Schedule\n\nWith a three-week voting period, in the event the proposal is supported, it\nshould pass around May 22nd. The upgrade will be expected to take place the\nfollowing week, at May 28th. The specific block halt-height is [3,318,000](https://www.mintscan.io/atomone/block/3318000).\n\n# Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v2 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests and\nintegration tests. \n\nValidators and node operators have joined a [public\ntestnet](https://testnet.explorer.allinbits.services/atomone-testnet-1) to\nparticipate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the AtomOne\nupgrades to the final release.\n\n# Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there\nalways exists a risk that the AtomOne experiences problems due to potential\nbugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems,\nvalidators are recommended to stop operating the network immediately.\nCoordination with validators will happen in the #validator-private channel of\nthe AtomOne Community Discord to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely\nthis will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider\nthe upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of AtomOne (v1.1.2)\n\n# Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this\nproposal:\n\nYES - You agree that the AtomOne chain should be updated with this release.\n\nNO - You disagree that the AtomOne chain should be updated with this release.\n\nABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote\neither for or against the proposal.\n",
