# Proposal

This proposal aims to gather community sentiment on sunsetting the Govgen
chain.

It is generally believed that Govgen has successfully served its purpose in
guiding community decisions about AtomOne's development. With AtomOne now live,
there is a case to be made that Govgen no longer serves a function—it's time to
release its allocated resources.

# Schedule

We propose stopping the Govgen chain at height [6900000](https://www.mintscan.io/govgen/block/6900000),
which will occur on May 30th at the end of the month.

# Consensus

Since Govgen's voting period is one year, there is a need to establish
community consensus to determine whether this proposal should be accepted
before May 30th. Although the chain is currently active it lacks utility and is
merely consuming resources. Since validators are the only interested parties,
the proposal is to proceed with the chain shutdown at the proposed block heigh
without considering quorum.

Therefore, we propose that if the proposal passes by May 29th 12pm UTC with a
simple majority—when the voting power of "Yes" votes exceeds "No" votes, then
it is to be considered that sentiment consensus has been met and that the
community is in agreement for the GovGen chain to be sunset.

If this happens, that validators are advised to shut down their machines at
block height 6900000.
